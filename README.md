# SQL-basicqueries

This was a basic MySQL homework assignment for the UC Berkeley Data Analytics bootcamp. For this assignment, we completed several queries on the tables of the [Sakila sample database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-structure.html).

These queries tested our ability to select using aggregate functions, joins (both inner and left), subqueries, and aliases. We also were asked to update and alter table data, consult table schemas, and create views. 


## Prerequisites

Queries were made on the [Sakila sample database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-installation.html) and were run in MySQLWorkbench.
